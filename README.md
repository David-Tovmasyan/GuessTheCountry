# GuessTheCountry
Simple game of guessing countries, the player must guess the country by it's capital, location and a famous person.

Note the name of country must be full and in English, 
also to prevent players from long writing (f. e. United States of America) correct answer would be USA,
United Kingdom -> UK etc.
